Guess that Subreddit is a quick hack developed by (@wtlangford, @eddiezane, and @kaushalp88), for the Spring 2014 HackNY student hackathon. 
It provides an awesome collaborative game in which a crowd of people vote on what subreddit a particular picture is from. 
At the end, the answer is revealed to the audience.
